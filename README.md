# Y’all-In - The Boardgames Metaxpirience

## Intro

Y’all-In is a VR boardgames platform where you and your friends can create and play your favorite boardgames in the Metaverse. We focus on realistic physics, intuitive interfaces for card and item manipulation, and single-step connectivity for friends and family, in order to provide the most immersive boardgames Metaxperience.

## Architecture

Y’all-In is composed by 3 major components:

1. A Firebase database - This is where user accounting and dynamic loading of boardgames is stored.
2. The networking infrastructure for which we use Normcore.
3. And Unity, where we build the room scene and all physics interactions.
